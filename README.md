## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I put into practice the 'mobile-first workflow' development on this project, and now I am able to say that it is much easier doing it this way rather than desktop-first, because I need to modify fewer things when scalling than vice versa.

### Continued development

I need to continue practicing how to position elements over the body, but, as always, practice makes perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Colored Overlay on Image Hover](https://wisdmlabs.com/blog/show-color-overlay-image-hover-using-css/) - On this page, I have learned a bit more about hover effect and how to use it over an image with CSS.
